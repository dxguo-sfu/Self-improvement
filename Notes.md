# The Six Pillars of Self-Esteem Part 1 : Self-Esteem - Basic Principles

## Chapter 1 : Self Esteem

1. Trust one's mind and know that one is worthy of happiness is the essence of self-esteem.
Higher self-esteem -> more likely to persist at a task
2. We tend to feel most comfortable, most "at home," with persons wbose self-esteem level resembles our own.
3. Respect myself and require that others deal with me respectfully
4. High self-esteem seeks the challenge and stimulation of worthwhile and demanding goals
Low self-esteem seeks the safety of the familiar and udnemanding. Confining oneself to the familiar and undemanding serves to weaken self-esteem
5. There is no greater barrier to romantic happiness than the fear that I am undeserving of love and that my destiny is to be hurt.
6. It would be hard to name a more certain sign of poor self-esteem than the need to perceive some other group as inferior
7. Self-esteem, high or low, tends to be a generator of self-fulfilling prophecies
8. Sometimes self-esteem is confused with boasting or bragging or arrogance; but such traits reflect not too much self-esteem, but too little; they reflect a lack of self-esteem. Persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is in being who they are, not in being better than someone else.
9. If my aim is to prove I am "enough," the project goes on to infinity - because the battle was already lost on the day I conceded the issue was debatable
    * While poor self-esteem often undercuts the capacity for real accomplishment, even among the most talented, it does not necessarily do so. What is far more certain is that it undercuts the capacity for satisfaction. (34)
