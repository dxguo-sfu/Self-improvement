Trust one's mind and know that one is worthy of happiness is the essence of self-esteem
Higher self-esteem -> more likely to persist at a task
Respect myself and require that others deal with me respectfully
High self-esteem seeks the challenge and stimulation of worthwhile and demanding goals
Low self-esteem seeks the safety of the familiar and udnemanding. Confining oneself to the familiar and undemanding serves to weaken self-esteem
There is no greater barrier to romantic happiness than the fear that I am undeserving of love and that my destiny is to be hurt.
It would be hard to name a more certain sign of poor self-esteem than the need to perceive some other group as inferior
Self-esteem, high or low, tends to be a generator of self-fulfilling prophecies
Sometimes self-esteem is confused with boasting or bragging or arrogance; but such traits reflect not too much self-esteem, but too little; they reflect a lack of self-esteem. Persons of high self-esteem are not driven to make themselves superior to others; they do not seek to prove their value by measuring themselves against a comparative standard. Their joy is in being who they are, not in being better than someone else.
